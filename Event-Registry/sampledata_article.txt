                "title": "The Attack on Pearl Harbor: A Day That Will Live in Infamy",
                "body": "The attack at Pearl Harbor so outraged Americans that the U.S. abandoned its policy of isolationism and declared war on Japan the following day -- officially bringing the United States into World War II.\n\nThe Japanese were tired of negotiations with the United States. They wanted to continue their expansion within Asia but the United States had placed an extremely restrictive embargo on Japan in the hopes of curbing Japan's aggression. Negotiations to solve their differences had not been going well.\n\nRather than giving in to U.S. demands, the Japanese decided to launch a surprise attack against the United States in an attempt to destroy the United States' naval power even before an official announcement of war was given.\n\nThe Japanese practiced and prepared carefully for their attack on Pearl Harbor. They knew their plan was extremely risky. The probability of success depended heavily on complete surprise.\n\nOn November 26, 1941, the Japanese attack force, led by Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, left Etorofu Island in the Kurils (located northeast of Japan) and began its 3,000-mile journey across the Pacific Ocean. Sneaking six aircraft carriers, nine destroyers, two battleships, two heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and three submarines across the Pacific Ocean was not an easy task.\n\nWorried that they might be spotted by another ship, the Japanese attack force continually zig-zagged and avoided major shipping lines. After a week and a half at sea, the attack force made it safely to its destination, about 230 miles north of the Hawaiian island of Oahu.\n\nOn the morning of December 7, 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor began. At 6:00 a.m., the Japanese aircraft carriers began launching their planes amid the rough sea. In total, 183 Japanese aircraft took to the air as part of the first wave of the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nAt 7:15 a.m., the Japanese aircraft carriers, plagued by even rougher seas, launched 167 additional planes to participate in the second wave of the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe first wave of Japanese planes reached the U.S. Naval Station at Pearl Harbor (located on the south side of the Hawaiian island of Oahu) at 7:55 a.m. on December 7, 1941.\n\nJust before the first bombs dropped on Pearl Harbor, Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, leader of the air attack, called out, \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\" (\"Tiger! Tiger! Tiger!\"), a coded message which told the entire Japanese navy that they had caught the Americans totally by surprise.\n\nSunday mornings were a time of leisure for many U.S. military personnel at Pearl Harbor. Many were either still asleep, in mess halls eating breakfast, or getting ready for church on the morning of December 7, 1941. They were completely unaware that an attack was imminent.\n\nThen the explosions started. The loud booms, pillars of smoke, and low-flying enemy aircraft shocked many into the realization that this was not a training exercise; Pearl Harbor was really under attack.\n\nDespite the surprise, many acted quickly. Within five minutes of the beginning of the attack, several gunners had reached their anti-aircraft guns and were trying to shoot down the Japanese planes.\n\nAt 8:00 a.m., Admiral Husband Kimmel, in charge of Pearl Harbor, sent out a hurried dispatch to all in the U.S. naval fleet, \"AIR RAID ON PEARL HARBOR X THIS IS NOT DRILL.\"\n\nThe Japanese had been hoping to catch U.S. aircraft carriers at Pearl Harbor, but the aircraft carriers were out to sea that day. The next major important naval target was the battleships.\n\nOn the morning of December 7, 1941, there were eight U.S. battleships at Pearl Harbor, seven of which were lined up at what was called Battleship Row, and one (the Pennsylvania) was in dry dock for repairs. (The Colorado, the only other battleship of the U.S.'s Pacific fleet, was not at Pearl Harbor that day.)\n\nSince the Japanese attack was a total surprise, many of the first torpedoes and bombs dropped on the unsuspecting ships hit their targets. The damage done was severe. Although the crews on board each battleship worked feverishly to keep their ship afloat, some were destined to sink.\n\nIn addition to the air assault on Battleship Row, the Japanese had launched five midget submarines. These midget subs, which were approximately 78 1/2 feet long and 6 feet wide and held only a two-man crew, were to sneak into Pearl Harbor and aid in the attack against the battleships. However, all five of these midget subs were sunk during the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nAttacking the U.S. aircraft on Oahu was an essential component of the Japanese attack plan. If the Japanese were successful in destroying a large portion of the U.S. airplanes, then they could proceed unhindered in the skies above Pearl Harbor. Plus, a counter-attack against the Japanese attack force would be much more unlikely.\n\nThus, some of the first wave of Japanese planes were ordered to target the airfields that surrounded Pearl Harbor.\n\nAs the Japanese planes reached the airfields, they found many of the American fighter planes lined up along the airstrips, wingtip to wingtip, making easy targets. The Japanese strafed and bombed the planes, hangers, and other buildings located near the airfields, including dormitories and mess halls.\n\nBy the time the U.S. military personnel at the airfields realized what was happening, there was little they could do. The Japanese were extremely successful at destroying most of the U.S. aircraft. A few individuals picked up guns and shot at the invading planes.\n\nA handful of U.S. fighter pilots were able to get their planes off the ground, only to find themselves vastly outnumbered in the air. Still, they were able to shoot down a few Japanese planes.\n\nBy 9:45 a.m., just under two hours after the attack had begun, the Japanese planes left Pearl Harbor and headed back to their aircraft carriers. The attack on Pearl Harbor was over.\n\nAll Japanese planes had returned to their aircraft carriers by 12:14 p.m. and just an hour later, the Japanese attack force began their long journey homeward.\n\nIn just under two hours, the Japanese had sunk four U.S. battleships (Arizona, California, Oklahoma, and West Virginia). The Nevada was beached and the other three battleships at Pearl Harbor received considerable damage.\n\nAlso damaged were three light cruisers, four destroyers, one minelayer, one target ship, and four auxiliaries.\n\nOf the U.S. aircraft, the Japanese managed to destroy 188 and damage an additional 159.\n\nThe death toll among Americans was quite high. A total of 2,335 servicemen were killed and 1,143 were wounded. Sixty-eight civilians were also killed and 35 were wounded. Nearly half of the servicemen that were killed were on board the Arizona when it exploded.\n\nAll this damage was done by the Japanese, who suffered very few losses themselves -- just 29 aircraft and five midget subs.\n\nThe news of the attack on Pearl Harbor quickly spread throughout the United States. The public was shocked and outraged. They wanted to strike back. It was time to join World War II.\n\nAt 12:30 p.m. on the day following the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave an address to Congress in which he declared that December 7, 1941, was \"a date that will live in infamy.\" At the end of the speech, Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war on Japan. With only one dissenting vote (by Representative Jeannette Rankin from Montana), Congress declared war, officially bringing the United States into World War II.",

                "body": "GRAND FORKS -- After nearly 80 years, Floyd Wells is coming home to North Dakota.\n\nThe remains of the Cavalier native and U.S. Navy crewman, who died in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, have been identified through DNA testing and will be returned to his family for burial at the North Dakota Veterans Cemetery in Mandan, said Neal Martin of Grand Forks, whose wife, Ann, is Wells' niece.\n\nThe ceremony is planned for Oct. 1.\n\n\"This is of historical significance,\" said Martin. \"I want people to remember his name.\"\n\nFloyd Arthur Wells enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1938, a few years after graduating from high school at Fairdale in northeast North Dakota.\n\nIn December 1941, he was one of five radio operators on the USS Arizona when it was attacked by Japanese aircraft, killing 1,177 crewmen, Martin said.\n\nThe battleship was struck by a bomb that penetrated its powder magazine, which caused a cataclysmic explosion and ignited a fire. The ship burned for two days in the aftermath of the attack.\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt declared Dec. 7, 1941, \"a date which will live in infamy\" in his radio address to the nation shortly after the attack that thrust the United States into World War II.\n\nFloyd Wells was the second child of Edna and Earl Wells' children - four sons and a daughter. The youngest, Phyllis, was Ann Martin's mother.\n\nOn that fateful Sunday morning in 1941, \"she was coming downstairs for breakfast when she heard on the radio that there was an attack on Pearl Harbor,\" Ann Martin said. Phyllis would have been 11 years old at the time. Her family was living in Fairdale, in northwestern Walsh County.\n\nAfter the attack, the Wells family received a telegram stating their son was missing in action. In early 1942, they received another one stating he was presumed killed in action.\n\nFloyd Wells was 24 years old.\n\n\"He never married,\" Martin said. \"He didn't get to have a life.\"\n\nMartin, who has been seeking information about his wife's uncle for years, found Wells' name on the muster roll of crewmen who were transferred from the USS Arizona to another Navy battleship after the attack.\n\n\"He was one of 15 people taken onto the USS Tennessee,\" he said. \"He was probably alive when he went to the Tennessee.\"\n\nWells also was listed as being at the military base hospital. Martin presumed he was buried in a mass grave of the unknown in the Punchbowl National Cemetery at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii.\n\n\"The government is exhuming them\" and trying to identify and return the remains to their families, Martin said.\n\nNeal and Ann Martin were the first family members to visit the WWII memorial in Hawaii, he said. He brought chalk and a fixative with him to take a rubbing of Wells' name from the wall where the list of the deceased is engraved, he said.\n\n\"No one was going to keep me away from that memorial.\"\n\nIn a cemetery in Cavalier, Wells also is memorialized on a gravestone engraved with the dates of his military service. His brother, Glenn Wells, ordered the stone from the Veterans Administration, Martin said.\n\nMartin has contributed information on Floyd Wells for a book, \"The Men of the USS Arizona,\" by T.J. Cooper.\n\nSeveral years ago, Ann Martin and her mother, brother and two sisters each provided DNA samples, saliva, to the Department of Defense to help the government identify crewmen who died at Pearl Harbor. The department oversees lab testing that attempts to match the DNA of unidentified military personnel with that of living relatives.\n\nFloyd Wells was officially accounted for June 17, but it took some time before relatives here were notified, Martin said.\n\n\"We found out in a roundabout way,\" he said. \"A professional genealogist who works for the Navy called me up and we talked.\"\n\nBut more information was not forthcoming because, Martin learned later, the Navy's policy is to inform only the oldest living relative of the deceased. In this case, that is an 83-year-old niece of Wells who lives in Washington state, but isn't well-known by family members here, he said.\n\nHis mother-in-law, Phyllis Wells Reichert, did not live to see the results of that testing or to learn that her brother's remains would be coming home. She died a couple of years ago.\n\n\"I wish my mom was here to see him,\" Ann Martin said. \"She and his brothers thought he went down with the ship.\"\n\nFloyd Wells' other siblings also are deceased, she said.\n\nSeveral family members, including Ann, her brother Terry Reichert of rural Hensel, and her sisters Karen Cataldi, Fargo, and Kristy Dornacker, Garrison, plan to attend the ceremony during which Floyd Wells will be laid to rest with full military honors at the North Dakota Veterans Cemetery in Mandan.\n\nTheir cousin, Curtis Wells of Missouri, said his uncle's remains will be flown, with military escort, to Fargo. Upon arrival, a ceremony with full military honors will be conducted and the casket will be processed in Fargo later that day, he said. The next day, the remains will be driven, with military escort, for the burial ceremony.\n\nCurtis Wells will be present for all of it, he said. His father, Glenn Wells, applied for the service medals that Floyd Wells earned in WWII, he said.\n\nHe and his cousins have no memory of their Uncle Floyd.\n\n\"We didn't know him,\" Curtis said. \"What we knew of him was what dad and my aunt said.\"\n\nOn a wall in their home, the Martins are reminded of Floyd Wells by a professionally framed and matted shadow box that displays his photo, a radioman patch, and several medals, including the Purple Heart, the American Defense Service Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Service Medal with one bronze star, and the World War II Victory Medal.\n\nAs Ann Martin looked at the black-and-white picture of the uncle she never met, a smiling, bright-eyed young man of barely 20 looks back.\n\n\"He's got curly hair, like Grandma Wells,\" she said.\n\nIt's \"unbelievable\" that DNA testing has made it possible for her family to have official proof, identifying his remains, and now to be able to finally lay him to rest in his home state, Ann said.\n\nCurtis Wells has similar feelings.\n\n\"You know, when you think about it, it's kind of amazing that some kind of record still exists after 80 years,\" he said. \"If they didn't have (DNA testing), they would never know.\"\n\nCurtis is planning to bring additional military papers and information related to Floyd's service for the Martins when he travels to North Dakota for the burial, he said. The return of Wells' remains means \"that he's been identified and he's coming home,\" Curtis said.\n\n\"You hear the word 'closure' a lot of times, but the bottom line to me is, he is one of many who made the ultimate sacrifice in World War II and gave his life in defense of our country.\"\n\nTo have his uncle buried in the North Dakota Veterans Cemetery \"is very important to me and my siblings,\" Curtis said. \"The only regret I have is that his siblings - or at least one of his siblings - aren't living to see their brother brought home.\"\n\nAlthough Floyd Wells could have been buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C., \"we decided that North Dakota was the best place. He's a local boy and I think he deserves the local recognition,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of guys died over there, and they deserve recognition for that - to me, that's so important. It's very very important that he is finally laid to rest there.\"\n\n\"To me, he is a hero,\" he said, \"and the people in North Dakota and other places shouldn't forget that.\"",

                "body": "The remains of the Cavalier, N.D., native and U.S. Navy crewman, who died in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, have been identified through DNA testing and will be returned to his family for burial at the North Dakota Veterans Cemetery in Mandan, said Neal Martin of Grand Forks, whose wife, Ann, is Wells' niece.\n\nThe ceremony is planned for Oct. 1.\n\n\"This is of historical significance,\" said Martin. \"I want people to remember his name.\"\n\nFloyd Arthur Wells enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1938, a few years after graduating from high school at Fairdale, N.D.\n\nIn December 1941, he was one of five radio operators on the USS Arizona when it was attacked by Japanese aircraft, killing 1,177 crewmen, Martin said.\n\nThe battleship was struck by multiple torpedo hits, which caused a cataclysmic explosion and ignited a fire. The ship burned for two days in the aftermath of the attack.\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt declared Dec. 7, 1941 \"a date which will live in infamy\" in his radio address to the nation shortly after the attack that thrust the United States into World War II.\n\nFloyd Wells was the second child of Edna and Earl Wells' children -- four sons and a daughter. The youngest, Phyllis, was Ann Martin's mother.\n\nOn that fateful Sunday morning in December 1941, \"she was coming downstairs for breakfast when she heard on the radio that there was an attack on Pearl Harbor,\" Ann Martin said. Phyllis would have been 11 years old at the time. Her family was living in Fairdale, in northwestern Walsh County.\n\nAfter the attack, the Wells received a telegram stating that their son was missing in action. In early 1942, they received another one stating that he was presumed killed in action.\n\nFloyd Wells was 24 years old.\n\n\"He never married,\" Martin said. \"He didn't get to have a life.\"\n\nMartin, who has been seeking information about his wife's uncle for years, found his name on the \"muster roll\" of crewmen who were transferred from the USS Arizona to another Navy battleship after the attack.\n\n\"He was one of 15 people taken onto the USS Tennessee,\" he said. \"He was probably alive when he went to the Tennessee.\"\n\nWells also was listed as being in the military base hospital. Martin presumed he was buried in a mass grave of the unknown in the Punchbowl National Cemetery at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii.\n\n\"The government is exhuming them\" and trying to identify and return the remains to their families, Martin said.\n\nHe and his wife, Ann, were the first family members to visit the WWII memorial in Hawaii, he said. He brought chalk and a fixative with him to take a rubbing of Wells' name from the wall where the list of the deceased is engraved, he said.\n\n\"No one was going to keep me away from that memorial.\"\n\nIn a cemetery in Cavalier, Wells is also memorialized on a gravestone engraved with the dates of his military service. His brother, Glenn Wells, ordered the stone from the Veterans Administration, Martin said.\n\nMartin has contributed information on Floyd Wells for a book, \"The Men of the USS Arizona,\" by T.J. Cooper.\n\nSeveral years ago, Ann Martin and her mother, brother and two sisters each provided a DNA samples, saliva, to the Department of Defense to help the government identify crewmen who died at Pearl Harbor. The Department oversees lab testing that attempts to match the DNA of unidentified military personnel with that of living relatives.\n\nFloyd Wells was officially accounted for June 17, but it took some time before relatives here were notified, Martin said.\n\n\"We found out in a roundabout way,\" he said. \"A professional genealogist who works for the Navy called me up and we talked.\"\n\nBut more information was not forthcoming because, Martin learned later, the Navy's policy is to inform only the oldest living relative of the deceased, who, in this case, is an 83-year-old niece of Wells who lives in Washington state, but isn't well-known by family members here, he said.\n\nHis mother-in-law, Phyllis Wells Reichert, did not live to see the results of that testing or to learn that her brother's remains would be coming home. She died a couple of years ago.\n\n\"I wish my mom was here to see him,\" Ann Martin said. \"She and his brothers thought he went down with the ship.\"\n\nFloyd Wells' other siblings also are deceased, she said.\n\nSeveral family members, including Ann, her brother Terry Reichert of rural Hensel, N.D., and her sisters Karen Cataldi, Fargo, and Kristy Dornacker, Garrison, N.D., plan to attend the ceremony during which Floyd Wells will be laid to rest with full military honors at the North Dakota Veterans Cemetery in Mandan.\n\nTheir cousin, Curtis Wells, of Bolivar, Mo., said his uncle's remains will be flown, with military escort, to Fargo. Upon arrival, a ceremony with full military honors will be conducted and the casket will be processed in Fargo later that day, he said. The next day, the remains will be driven, with military escort, for the burial ceremony.\n\nCurtis Wells will be present for all of it, he said.

                "body": "Robert B. Stinnett, Day of Deceit: The Truth about FDR and Pearl Harbor (New York, Free Press, 2000)\n\nA Second World War Navy radioman turned journalist, Robert Stinnett was in the National Archives in Belmont, California, researching a campaign-year picture book on George Bush's South Pacific wartime navy career in aerial reconnaissance -- George Bush: His World War II Years (Washington, D.C., Brassey's, 1992) -- and encountered unindexed duplicate copies of Pearl Harbor radio intercept records of Japanese Navy code transmissions -- documentary evidence of what actually happened at Pearl Harbor and how it came about.\n\nAfter eight years of further research and a prolonged case at law under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain partial release of these materials, Stinnett published Day of Deceit (2000). A Japanese translation appeared within a year, understandably.\n\nStinnett demonstrates, on the basis of extensive incontrovertible factual evidence and self-evidently accurate analysis that President Roosevelt oversaw the contrivance and deployment of a closely-guarded secret plan to goad the Japanese into attacking Pearl Harbor and monitor them while they did it. Stinnett hypothesizes that Roosevelt did this in order to precipitate an unwilling American public into supporting intervention in the Second World War, but whatever the motives or purposes, the facts are now abundantly clear. Stinnett establishes and proves his case with voluminous documentary evidence, including forty-seven pages of Appendices [p. 261-308] presenting photographic reproductions of key official records, as well as numerous others reproduced in the body of the text, and 65 pages [309-374] of closely detailed reference notes. Day Of Deceit: The Tru... Robert Stinnett Best Price: $2.51 Buy New $8.50 (as of 07:00 EDT - Details)\n\nThis evidence proves Stinnett's factual assertions, arguments and conclusions. His research files and notes are deposited at the Hoover Institute library at Stanford. Day of Deceit is exemplary documentary historiography. It presents the material testimony on which its analysis and conclusions are based. Its validity will be clear to any fair-minded reader. Stinnett's book settles and resolves rational, candid, honest, fact-based discussion and debate about the background of the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nAs Stinnett shows, the plan that eventuated in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was set in motion in early October 1940 based on an \"eight-action memo, dated October 7, 1940 ... by Lieutenant Commander Arthur H. McCollum, head of the Far East desk of the Office of Navy Intelligence.\" Of course, it is unlikely that McCollum drafted it on his own initiative, but this is where Stinnett's paper trail starts. \"Its eight actions call for virtually inciting a Japanese attack on American ground, air, and naval forces in Hawaii, as well as on British and Dutch colonial outposts in the Pacific region....\" [p. 6-8; the memorandum is reproduced on 261-267]:\n\nA. Make an arrangement with Britain for use of British bases in the Pacific, particularly Singapore.\n\nB. Make an arrangement with Holland for the use of base facilities and acquisition of supplies in the Dutch East Indies [now Indonesia].\n\nC. Give all possible aid to the Chinese government of Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nD. Send a division of long-range heavy cruisers to the Orient, Philippines, or Singapore.\n\nE. Send two divisions of submarines to the Orient.\n\nF. Keep the main strength of the US Fleet, now in the Pacific, in the vicinity of the Hawaiian islands.\n\nG. Insist that the Dutch refuse to grant Japanese demands for undue economic concessions, particularly oil.\n\nH. Complete embargo all trade with Japan, in collaboration with a similar embargo imposed by the British Empire.\n\nAs the plan unfolded its development was closely monitored through decoded intercepts of Japanese diplomatic and naval radio communications. \"McCollum oversaw the routing of communications intelligence to FDR from early 1940 to December 7, 1941 and provided the President with intelligence reports on Japanese military and diplomatic strategy. Every intercepted and decoded Japanese military and diplomatic report destined for the White House went through the Far East Asia section of ONI, which he oversaw.\n\nThe section served as a clearinghouse for all categories of intelligence reports.... Each report prepared by McCollum for the President was based on radio intercepts gathered and decoded by a worldwide network of American military cryptographers and radio intercept operators.... Few people in America's government or military knew as much about Japan's activities and intentions as McCollum.\"[8] Knowledge of the plan was closely held, limited to 13 Roosevelt administration members and chief military officers and 21 members of Naval Intelligence and related operations [listed in Appendix E 307-308]. Item C was already US policy when McCollum wrote his memo. Item F was set in motion on October 8, Items A, B and G on October 16, 1940, Item D and E by November 12, 1940. [Chap. 1 n. 8 p. 311-312; 120 ff. etc.].\n\nMeanwhile, also in the fall of 1940, campaigning for a third term in Boston on October 30, President Roosevelt said: \"I have said this before, but I shall say it again and again and again: Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.\" On November 1 in Brooklyn he said \"I am fighting to keep our people out of foreign wars. And I will keep on fighting.\" At Rochester on the 2nd he said \"Your national government ... is equally a government of peace -- a government that intends to retain peace for the American people.\"\n\nThe same day in Buffalo he asserted \"Your President says this country is not going to war,\" and in Cleveland on the next he declared \"The first purpose of our foreign policy is to keep our country out of war.\" [William Henry Chamberlin, \"How Franklin Roosevelt Lied America Into War,\" in Harry Elmer Barnes, Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace (Caldwell, Idaho, Caxton, 1953), Chapter Eight, p. 485-491].\n\nAdmiral Richardson, commander of the Pacific Fleet, opposed Roosevelt's orders [Item F] to station the fleet at Pearl Harbor as putting the fleet at risk, so he was replaced with Admiral Kimmel, with Admiral Anderson of ONI as Kimmel's third in command at Pearl Harbor, to supervise the radio intercept operation there, unbeknownst to Kimmel. [10-14; 33-34] \"Anderson was sent to Hawaii as an intelligence gatekeeper\"[36]. When he arrived he established his personal housing well away from Pearl Harbor, out of range of the coming attack.\n\nThough he was commander of the seven battleships which bore the brunt of the attack with the loss of over two thousand lives, Admiral Anderson was safe at home on the other side of the mountain when the attack came. [36-37; 244, 247] Meanwhile, the commanders in Hawaii, \"Admiral Husband Kimmel and Lieutenant General Walter Short, were deprived of intelligence that might have made them more alert to the risks entailed in Roosevelt's policy, but they obeyed his direct order of November 27 and 28, 1941: 'The United States desires that Japan commit the first overt act.'\" [6-8] Afterward, they were scape-goated.\n\nIn early January 1941 the Japanese decided that in the event of hostilities with the US they would commence with a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. American intelligence learned of this plan on January 27 [30-32]. On July 21, 1941 Lieutenant Commander McCollum's Item H lit the fuse. Up through late November the White House continued to block concerted attempts by Japanese diplomats to discuss an accommodation. [On this diplomatic history see Charles Beard , American Foreign Policy in the Making (1946) and President Roosevelt and the Coming of the War (1948); Frederic Rockwell Sanborn, Design For War (1951); and Charles Tansill, Back Door To War (1952).]\n\nBeginning November 16, 1941, radio intercepts revealed the formation of the Japanese fleet near the Kurile Islands north of Japan and from November 26 through the first week of December tracked it across the Pacific to Hawaii [41-59 etc.]. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark (one of the 34 informed participants) ordered Kimmel to dispatch his aircraft carriers with a large escort fleet to deliver planes to Wake and Midway Islands. \"On orders from Washington, Kimmel left his oldest vessels inside Pearl Harbor and sent twenty-one modern warships, including his two aircraft carriers, west toward Wake and Midway... With their departure the warships remaining in Pearl Harbor were mostly 27-year-old relics of World War I.\"\n\nThat is, the battleships sunk at Pearl Harbor with their crews were employed as decoys [152-154]. On 22 November 1941, a week after the Japanese fleet began to assemble and four days before it sailed for Oahu, Admiral Ingersoll issued a \"Vacant Sea\" order that cleared its path of all shipping and on 25 November he ordered Kimmel to withdraw his ships patrolling the area from which the aerial attack would be staged [144-145]. FDR kept close tabs on the plot's final unfolding while radio intercepts continued to track its voyage toward Hawaii [161-176].\n\nStinnett comments: \"Pearl Harbor's Battleship Row and its old dilapidated warships presented a mouth-watering target. But it was a major strategic mistake for the Empire. Japan's 360 warplanes should have concentrated on Pearl Harbor's massive oil stores ... and destroyed the industrial capacity of the Navy's dry docks, machine shops, and repair facilities\"[249]. Six months later, at the battles of Coral Sea (May 4-8, 1942) and Midway (June 4-7), the warships of the Pacific Fleet which were at sea when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred permanently destroyed the offensive capacity of the Japanese Navy to operate in the eastern Pacific and permanently crippled its defensive capacity in the western Pacific. Thereafter, as informed observers understood, a Japanese attack or invasion of the West Coast of America was a total logistical impossibility. Nevertheless, two months later, the internment of West Coast Japanese American citizens began in August 1942.\n\nThe Pearl Harbor coverup began immediately afterward with the court marshals of Admiral Kimmel and General Short, continued through eight Congressional investigations during and after the war, with the purging and withholding of documents and false testimony by participants and others [253-260 & passim; 309-310] and persisted through the Congressional hearings chaired by Strom Thurmond in 1995 [257-258].\n\nAt the date of publication (2000) numerous documents were still withheld from Stinnett or released in extensively censored form. But his case is conclusively proven on the basis of the evidence he presents, as any fair-minded reader can see. The only way to refute or debunk it would be to establish that his documentary evidence is forged, and prove it. In face of the character of this evidence, the idea is nonsensical.\n\nA key break for Stinnett's research was his discovery of duplicate copies of reports of Japanese naval code transmissions from the Pearl Harbor radio-intercept station routed after the war to the Belmont (California) National Archives, and still there long after the copies in the Washington, D.C. archive files had been disappeared.\n\nRecent writers pretending to debunk Stinnett's evidence have resurrected claims that the Japanese naval codes had not been deciphered and that the Japanese fleet maintained radio silence -- claims that have been refuted repeatedly for decades. Famously, the radio operator of the American liner Mariposa intercepted repeated signals from the Japanese fleet steaming toward Hawaii and relayed its progressive bearings to the Navy. This was well-known during the war to American seamen of the Pacific merchant marine and is mentioned in published accounts.\n\nThe pretense that the Japanese naval and diplomatic codes had not been deciphered was first refuted in a federal court in Chicago in 1943. As her biographer Ralph G. Martin recounts, Cissy Patterson, managing editor of the Washington Times-Herald on December 7, 1941 (and for decades before and after) was opposed to American intervention in another world war -- like over 80% of her fellow Americans, including her brother Joe Patterson, publisher of the New York News, and her cousin Robert McCormick, publisher of the Chicago Tribune. Serving in France as a battlefield officer, Robert was wounded, twice gassed, and decorated for valor. His Chicago Tribune, like his cousins' newspapers and numerous others, especially off the east coast, was vocally anti-interventionist -- until Pearl Harbor.\n\nIn Cissy (New York, Simon & Schuster, 1979) Martin writes: \"As the news of the disaster [at Pearl Harbor] kept coming in [to the Times-Herald's newsroom], Cissy bitterly asked [her Sunday Editor] Roberts about Roosevelt, 'Do you suppose hearranged this?' Later when she learned that American cryptographers had broken the Japanese codes before Pearl Harbor, she was convinced that Roosevelt had known in advance that the Japanese intended to attack\"[418]. \"The Chicago Tribune, the Times-Herald, and two dozen other papers later printed an article by a Tribune war correspondent which indicated that the United States had prevailed [at Midway] because the Japanese codes had been broken.... The Department of Justice decided to file charges that the Tribune and the Times-Herald had betrayed U.S. military secrets.... Attorney General Francis Biddle felt the disclosure of this breakthrough had been tantamount to treason because it gave the Japanese the chance to change their codes. Waldrop [Times-Herald editor] was called to Chicago to testify before a grand jury... In the middle of the testimony, the Navy disclosed that a Navy censor had passed the Tribune article. Forced to drop the case, Biddle said he 'felt like a fool.'\" [431-432] He wasn't the only one.",

In April 1942, the success of the Doolittle Raid on Japan was leavened by the horrors of the Bataan Death March, during which thousands of US and Philippine soldiers died.\n\nBut mid-1942 saw the Battle of the Coral Sea, when the Allies beat the Japanese in the first naval battle in which the combatants were never within sight of each other, and the Battle of Midway, when outnumbered US forces fooled and cripple the Japanese navy.\n\nBy February 1943, the US had secured Guadalcanal after the first major Allied offensive in the theater. From there, US forces were able to plot retribution for the attack that started it all.\n\nOn April 13, 1943, US naval intelligence intercepted a coded signal sent to Japanese commanders in the area around Bougainville, in the Solomon Islands northwest of Guadalcanal.\n\nThe US had long since broke Japan's codes. The April 13 message was sent in a new variant, but US intelligence deciphered it in short order.\n\n\"On April 18 CINC Combined Fleet will visit RXZ, R-, and RXP in accordance with the following schedule...\" the message began. Adm. Isokoru Yamamoto, commander in chief of Japan's Combined Fleet and planner of the Pearl Harbor attack, was visiting Japanese units in the Solomons.\n\nThe message revealed not only the trip but also the schedule, the planes - two Mitsubishi G4M \"Betty\" medium bombers escorted by six Zero fighters - that would be involved, the orders for commanders at Bougainville, and the recommended uniforms.\n\nYamamoto was one of the most charismatic and forward-thinking naval officers of his generation. He graduated from Japanese Naval Academy in 1904 and fought in the Russo-Japanese war, where he lost two fingers at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905.\n\nHe went to the US in the 1920s, learning English and studying at Harvard and at the US Naval War College, where he learned about a new style of naval warfare fought with carrier and island-based planes.\n\nHe reformed Japan's navy and was highly regarded by sailors and the Japanese royal family. While he was no pacifist, he was part of a moderate faction within the navy.\n\nHe criticized bellicosity from right-wing ultranationalists, scorned the army and its leaders who undercut civilian officials, and resisted an alliance with Nazi Germany. This earned him death threats.\n\nAs Japan's naval attache in Washington in the late 1920s, he traveled the US and witnessed its might.\n\n\"Anyone who has seen the auto factories in Detroit and the oil fields in Texas,\" he said later, \"knows that Japan lacks the national power for a naval race with America.\"\n\nHe cautioned against a war with the US but took part in its planning and believed only a knockout blow could spare Japan a ruinous end. \"We should do our best to decide the fate of the war on the very first day,\" he said.\n\nHis plan for a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was resisted, but he pushed it through, noting the irony of spearheading a mission he opposed. \"Alas, is that fate?\" he wrote to a friend.\n\nDespite Yamamoto's reservations about the war, he became the face of the enemy after Pearl Harbor, appearing on the cover of Time magazine on December 22, 1941, under the headline \"Japan's Aggressor.\"\n\nIf the name \"Operation Vengeance\" didn't illustrate US sentiment toward him, Pacific Fleet chief Adm. William \"Bull\" Halsey got the point across with the order, \"TALLY HO X LET'S GET THE BASTARD.\"\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt is reputed to have told the Navy, \"Get Yamamoto.\" (It's not clear he actually said that.) Adm. Chester Nimitz, the US commander in the Pacific, gave the go-ahead to shoot down Yamamoto's plane - a task assigned to the 339th Fighter Squadron.\n\nBut all the motivation didn't make the operation easier.\n\nNavy and Marine fighters didn't have the range to intercept Yamamoto and his escorts over Bougainville. The Army Air Force's twin-engine P-38G Lighting had the range to get there and the firepower to deal with the bombers and the fighters.\n\nEighteen P-38s - 16 for the attack and two extras - were selected and outfitted with extra tanks of fuel. Maj. John Mitchell, commander of the 339th, said he wasn't sure the P-38s could take off with the added weight.\n\nFour fighters, called the Killer Division, were to attack the bombers, one of which would be carrying Yamamoto. The rest would attack the fighter escorts.\n\nTo avoid detection, planners wanted the P-38s to fly \"at least 50 miles offshore of these islands, which meant dead-reckoning over 400 miles over water at fifty feet or less, a prodigious feat of navigation,\" according to a history of the 13th Fighter Command, of which the 339th Fighter Squadron was part.\n\nThe approach was complicated by the lack of radar to guide the P-38s. They would have to navigate with charts, though estimates of Yamamoto's plane's speed and the weather conditions, as well as his reputation for punctuality, allowed US planners to calculate where he'd be.\n\nThey planned for a 1,000-mile round trip, with a 600-mile approach flight from the south. Mitchell, the squadron commander, gave the plan 1,000-to-1 odds of success.\n\nThey left Henderson Field early on April 18, 1943 - the first anniversary of the Doolittle Raid. The monotony of the long flight combined with the low altitude increased the risks. One pilot counted sharks to stay awake; he saw 48.\n\nDespite lacking navigational aids, they got to Bougainville just as Yamamoto's convoy - the two bombers and six fighters 1,500 feet above them - flew into the area.\n\nTwelve of the P-38s climbed to the Zeroes; the other four headed to the bombers, not sure which carried Yamamoto.\n\nThe US fighters split up and chased the bombers, shooting both down. One crashed into the jungle on Bougainville, killing all aboard - including Yamamoto. The other plunged into the ocean.\n\nJapanese troops on Bougainville eventually found the wreckage of Yamamoto's plane. The bodies on board were cremated and put in boxes that returned to Japan.\n\n\"His cremation pit was filled, and two papaya trees, his favorite fruit, were planted on the mound,\" according to the 13th Fighter Command history. \"A shrine was erected, and Japanese naval personnel cared for the graves until the end of the war.\"\n\nThe US planes, minus one downed during the operation, returned to Henderson Field around noon, with some running out of fuel as they touched down.\n\nWhile Yamamoto met his end on April 18, 1943, how it arrived was less clear.\n\nCapt. Thomas Lanphier, who led the four fighters targeting the Japanese bombers, and his wingman, 1st. Lt. Rex Barber, were both credited with a kill on the mission.\n\nThe Air Force reviewed records in the 1970s and reduced it to a half-kill each, but it remained unclear who had shot down the bomber carrying Yamamoto.\n\nIn 1998, a panel of the surviving US pilots and one Japanese Zero pilot considered eyewitness comments, reports from Barber and Lanphier, and an examination of the bomber that crashed on Bougainville.",

This earned him death threats.\n\nAs Japan's naval attache in Washington in the late 1920s, he traveled the US and witnessed its might.\n\n\"Anyone who has seen the auto factories in Detroit and the oil fields in Texas,\" he said later, \"knows that Japan lacks the national power for a naval race with America.\"\n\nHe cautioned against a war with the US but took part in its planning and believed only a knockout blow could spare Japan a ruinous end. \"We should do our best to decide the fate of the war on the very first day,\" he said.\n\nHis plan for a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was resisted, but he pushed it through, noting the irony of spearheading a mission he opposed. \"Alas, is that fate?\" he wrote to a friend.\n\nDespite Yamamoto's reservations about the war, he became the face of the enemy after Pearl Harbor, appearing on the cover of Time magazine on December 22, 1941, under the headline \"Japan's Aggressor.\"\n\nIf the name \"Operation Vengeance\" didn't illustrate US sentiment toward him, Pacific Fleet chief Adm. William \"Bull\" Halsey got the point across with the order, \"TALLY HO X LET'S GET THE BASTARD.\"\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt is reputed to have told the Navy, \"Get Yamamoto.\" (It's not clear he actually said that.) Adm. Chester Nimitz, the US commander in the Pacific, gave the go-ahead to shoot down Yamamoto's plane -- a task assigned to the 339th Fighter Squadron.\n\nBut all the motivation didn't make the operation easier.\n\nNavy and Marine fighters didn't have the range to intercept Yamamoto and his escorts over Bougainville. The Army Air Force's twin-engine P-38G Lighting had the range to get there and the firepower to deal with the bombers and the fighters.\n\nEighteen P-38s -- 16 for the attack and two extras -- were selected and outfitted with extra tanks of fuel. Maj. John Mitchell, commander of the 339th, said he wasn't sure the P-38s could take off with the added weight.\n\nFour fighters, called the Killer Division, were to attack the bombers, one of which would be carrying Yamamoto. The rest would attack the fighter escorts.\n\nTo avoid detection, planners wanted the P-38s to fly \"at least 50 miles offshore of these islands, which meant dead-reckoning over 400 miles over water at fifty feet or less, a prodigious feat of navigation,\" according to a history of the 13th Fighter Command, of which the 339th Fighter Squadron was part.\n\nThe approach was complicated by the lack of radar to guide the P-38s. They would have to navigate with charts, though estimates of Yamamoto's plane's speed and the weather conditions, as well as his reputation for punctuality, allowed US planners to calculate where he'd be.\n\nThey planned for a 1,000-mile round trip, with a 600-mile approach flight from the south. Mitchell, the squadron commander, gave the plan 1,000-to-1 odds of success.\n\nThey left Henderson Field early on April 18, 1943 -- the first anniversary of the Doolittle Raid. The monotony of the long flight combined with the low altitude increased the risks. One pilot counted sharks to stay awake; he saw 48.\n\nDespite lacking navigational aids, they got to Bougainville just as Yamamoto's convoy -- the two bombers and six fighters 1,500 feet above them -- flew into the area.\n\nTwelve of the P-38s climbed to the Zeroes; the other four headed to the bombers, not sure which carried Yamamoto.\n\nThe US fighters split up and chased the bombers, shooting both down. One crashed into the jungle on Bougainville, killing all aboard -- including Yamamoto. The other plunged into the ocean.\n\nJapanese troops on Bougainville eventually found the wreckage of Yamamoto's plane. The bodies on board were cremated and put in boxes that returned to Japan.\n\n\"His cremation pit was filled, and two papaya trees, his favorite fruit, were planted on the mound,\" according to the 13th Fighter Command history. \"A shrine was erected, and Japanese naval personnel cared for the graves until the end of the war.\"\n\nThe US planes, minus one downed during the operation, returned to Henderson Field around noon, with some running out of fuel as they touched down.\n\nWhile Yamamoto met his end on April 18, 1943, how it arrived was less clear.\n\nCapt. Thomas Lanphier, who led the four fighters targeting the Japanese bombers, and his wingman, 1st. Lt. Rex Barber, were both credited with a kill on the mission.\n\nThe Air Force reviewed records in the 1970s and reduced it to a half-kill each, but it remained unclear who had shot down the bomber carrying Yamamoto.\n\nIn 1998, a panel of the surviving US pilots and one Japanese Zero pilot considered eyewitness comments, reports from Barber and Lanphier, and an examination of the bomber that crashed on Bougainville.",
